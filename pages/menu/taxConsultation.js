        What to Expect From Your Free Tax Consultation
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        TaxRise is one of the nation’s top tax relief companies – and the
        fastest growing. Our innovative two-phase approach to tax relief, paired
        with in-house developed software, helped us achieve this status.
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        Our success would not be possible without the initial tax consultation.
        We pre-qualify our clients from the beginning by offering them realistic
        resolutions and giving them access to a free tax consultant.
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        The tax relief survey contains a few questions to help us evaluate your
        financial situation. As soon as you complete the survey, it is sent
        immediately to a Resolution Officer for review.
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        Your Resolution Officer will review the information you provided and,
        during our office hours, will call you to begin the tax consultation.
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        Before you speak with a free tax consultant, try to have a rough
        estimate of the amount the IRS claims you owe. Also, make sure to
        confirm any unfiled tax years you might have.
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        However, if you’re not sure how much you owe – no problem! We can
        determine that information for you during the consultation.
      </Typography>

        During the Tax Consultation
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        The free tax consultation phone call is the first step in your journey
        to tax relief. During your consultation, a Resolution Officer will take
        the time to learn more about your current tax situation and verify if
        you qualify for the Fresh Start Program.
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        These questions will include:
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body" fontWeight={"bold"}>
        your current tax debt amount (and if it is state or federal)
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body" fontWeight={"bold"}>
        your monthly expenses and income
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body" fontWeight={"bold"}>
        some basic information on any assets you may own (such as a house or a
        car)
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        Your assigned Resolution Officer will be able to answer any questions
        you may have regarding our process, the IRS, and tax relief.
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        While some smaller companies offer free tax lawyer consultations, our
        tax lawyers spend their entire day resolving tax debt with the IRS. Most
        of their effort is dedicated to rigorous negotiation with IRS examiners.
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        Your free tax consultation phone call will last approximately thirty
        minutes and is broken up into three parts:
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body" fontWeight={"bold"}>
        Your Situation— The Resolution Officer will give you the opportunity to
        tell them how you ended up in tax debt, so that we have the proper
        perspective moving forward.
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body" fontWeight={"bold"}>
        The Interview — We ask our questions to determine if you qualify for the
        Fresh Start Program.
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body" fontWeight={"bold"}>
        Your Options — After we confirm whether you are a candidate for tax
        relief, we will map out the most likely tax relief scenarios and help
        you determine the next steps.

        If you qualify for the Fresh Start Program and choose to work with us,
        we will use the following process:
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        Discovery Phase, plus Analysis and Strategy: After your initial tax
        consultation, we will acquire all necessary documents to prepare your
        case for the best resolution possible. You will be assigned your very
        own TaxRise team, who will review the findings and create a strategy for
        your case.
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        Review and Advise: Before your TaxRise team files paperwork for the
        resolution, we will meet with you to share our findings and present our
        strategy for your approval.
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        Presentation, Negotiation, and Submission: Once you approve of our plan,
        we will prepare your case documents for presentation. Then, our experts
        will present your case to the IRS (or State) and negotiate until we
        achieve the best possible resolution. After your final approval of the
        resolution, we will submit the case on your behalf.
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body">
        Compliance: Unlike other companies, TaxRise sets you up for success
        after our primary services are complete. By working with you and
        offering you tools to stay compliant, we’ll help you avoid accumulating
        tax debt again.
      </Typography>
