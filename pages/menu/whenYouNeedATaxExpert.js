          What to Look for in a Tax Resolution Professional
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">
          If you’re behind on your taxes, then resolving your tax issues should
          be an immediate priority. Working with a tax relief professional can
          save you tremendous time and help navigate the convoluted rules and
          regulations that make up the Internal Revenue Code. Here are some
          helpful tips in selecting a tax resolution expert:

          Understand the Cost of Going it Alone
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">
          Before you hire a good income tax attorney or tax resolution
          specialist, you as a taxpayer, should understand why you need him/her.
          The advantages of hiring an expert for your tax problems and tax
          resolution are many. The expert handles everything and you get back
          your peace of mind because you know you’re not risking your financial
          and personal freedom. Doing it yourself and facing IRS tax audit
          alone, without much knowledge about the intrinsic process of IRS is
          like gambling and may result in huge fine and jail terms.

          Don’t be penny-wise but pound foolish
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">
          By not hiring a tax attorney or tax resolution specialist you can save
          a little amount of money, but if you are not able to negotiate a
          settlement with the IRS, you are not only losing money but you will
          also have to pay higher fines. Without the expert knowledge of a tax
          attorney or IRS licensed enrolled agent you may lose affordable IRS
          payment plans and lesser tax penalties. Unsolved tax problems
          including back taxes and other IRS problems can drain you financially
          and emotionally.

          Know that every tax relief case is different
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">
          To find the best income tax attorney or tax resolution specialist, you
          need to know that every tax relief case is different. So what you need
          is a customized and personalized attention. The good attorneys and
          specialists will not offer a one-size-fits-all approach for your tax
          resolutions. You should choose a tax lawyer who will provide you
          customized service and who has lots of experience and an excellent
          track record.

          Look for a firm that offers transparency
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">
          You should always choose a firm that is transparent and provides you a
          clear view of the whole process including the costs associated with
          it. There may be tax resolution and tax relief services who quote very
          low entry level fees just to get the clients. Once they get the
          taxpayer as the client, later day keep on adding extra cost like
          additional appellate representation fees. So, you should hire a
          transparent firm which will discuss about your IRS tax problem and
          will find out a tax resolution with clear cost elements.

          Understand your tax settlement options
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body">
          Your tax lawyer or the IRS licensed enrolled agent should let you know
          about the different tax settlement options you have in your case. You
          should know that about the options of your IRS problem resolutions up
          front before start of the process.
